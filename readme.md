# Python RESTful weather API

## User story

> As an API user I want to get min, max, average and median temperature and humidity for given city and period of time

## Goals

> Create locally running RESTful web API

> That accepts a request with 'city' and 'period' args

> Fetches weather data for that location and period of time from some public API

> Computes min, max, average and median temperature and humidity for that location and period

## Extra Goals

> Provide a view which renders a bar chart for the requested data

> Deploy it somewhere
